- started bulding on the 19.10.2021
- continue building (20.10.2021 22:51)
- doesn't seem to work (20.10.2021 23:41)
- - output is 1000 0100 when data all = 0
- testing if expected volatage (20.10.2021 23:43)
- first tranceiver voltage at 0.6V (really high for 0) (20.10.2021 23:46)
- - ground not connected (20.10.2021 23:48)
- 0001 0100 when data 0 (20.10.2021 23:54)
- *first tranceiver should work fine (20.10.2021 23:55)*
- C0 not connected to ground (fixed it) (20.10.2021 23:59)
- 0000 1000 at Data 0
- sum outputs of first and second full adder are correct (21.10.2021 00:01)
- 3rd full adder first sum 1, b1 high (should be both 0) (21.10.2021 00:03)
- forgot to connect b1 (21.10.2021 00:06)
- didn't forget to connect but rather connected it wrongly (two cables to a1) (21.10.2021 00:07)
- - fixed it
- 0000 0000 at data 0 (21.10.2021 00:07)
- 0000 0000 at data 0 * 1 (21.10.2021 00:08)
- 0000 1000 at data 1 * 1 (21.10.2021 00:11)
- data from first tranceiver gets sent wrongly, have to reverse it (21.10.2021 00:18)
- reversed order (21.10.2021 00:23)
- 0001 0000 ad data 0 (21.10.2021 00:24)
- loose cable (21.10.2021 00:27)
- 0000 0000 at data 0 (21.10.2021 00:27)
- 0000 0000 at data 1 * 1 (21.10.2021 00:28)
- testing 2 * 3 (21.10.2021 00:29)
- 0000 0110 at 0011 * 0010 which is correct (21.10.2021 00:32)
- 1101 0001 at 1111 * 1111 which is correct (21.10.2021 00:34)
- **IT WORKS :D**
