- Instruction register is programmable and saves data correctly (10.10.2021 16:09)
- every submodule works,computer somehow doesn't
- programming ram is a nightmare, fml
- 001 works, so computer really should also work
- program counter works
- eeprom work
- instruction ram works
- when i recall correctly memory ram,alu and so also worked
- only problem might be the restiger between instruction ram and eeprom,have to check if wirred correctly, otherwise everything really should work
- tomorrow (15.10.2021) and the upcomming days focus on writing the matura
- computer works to 90% so I really hope that's enough
- primary goal now maybe to write a actual program which the computer could use to do something usefull (eulers number or idk) simple math stuff
- and FINISH WRITING MATURA
- give up for now, work in the final weak again on it, programm it again, and just hope it works
